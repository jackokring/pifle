=====
This project is for programming the PIF for Pi with useful functions. By default all states (selected on J4 non power pins with jumpers) pass through SPI and I2C. By default also I2C address 0x1A [[register-0]] contains the output to J3 except pin 5, and the 4th bit lights the on board red LED. The register defaults to the [[jumper]] possibilities needed to set the state. This makes it easy to copy a jumper setting to achive a state. Seven LEDs and a resistor are suggested for J3.
