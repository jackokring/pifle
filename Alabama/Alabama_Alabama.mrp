Design Errors/Warnings
----------------------

WARNING - map: FEATURE/EFBInst_0: I2C_PORT was set to ENABLE by ngdbuild
     generated property. Setting in preference file was ignored.
WARNING - map: The JTAG port has been disabled in this project and JTAG pins
     will be configured as General Purpose IO.  You have to use JTAGENB pin in
     hardware to change the personality of the port from JTAG pins to general
     purpose IO.  Reference MACHXO2 Handbook for details on dual function JTAG
     port.
WARNING - map: GSR inference option has been disabled but the design contains a
     GSR component.
ERROR - map: FEATURE/EFBInst_0: On-Chip Oscillator is not instantiated in the
     design. Therefore, it cannot be used as clock source for TimerCounter.

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is 'GSRnX'.

GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
